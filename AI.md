# Documenting the use of AI tools in this project

## Introduction
I have done quite an extensive bit of coding myself in many languages and while I have a decent amount of experience
in writing code, I mostly worked in iterative depth first approaches or sequential approaches. I also rarely was involved
in automated testing. As such I am trying my best to keep the use of AI tools to a minimum. However, I do recognise that
it is an important tool for reducing repeated tasks such as creating similar code mainly for formatting and parsing inputs
in the UI. As such, I have created this file to document all of my uses of AI that are more widespread such as auto-completing
methods. The following is an example of how I plan to document each use:

---

## Example.file
### Methods involved:
* Method 1
* Method 2
* Method 3
* Source Method

### What and how AI tool was used
explanation

### What worked and what did not

### Estimated Time saved: xx minutes/hrs


This will be the format that this file will adhere to. Any local changes (for smaller uses), will be documented in comments
above the method itself inside the code file.

## Commands.java
### Methods involved:
* Commands initialise(String command, int commandCode)
* Get and Set methods

### Parser.java
* Commands parseInputFromUser(String command)

### What and how AI tool was used
Chatgpt was used to create the initialise, get and set methods with reference to the initial variables already declared
inside the Commands.java file and the shell of the parseInputFromUser method inside Parser.java. Subsequently, the
parseInputFromUser method was changed accordingly to match the command initialise method. These method templates were
entirely generated by Chatgpt with some minor edits on my end.

### What worked and what did not
Making the prompt specific to what I am doing, with some examples of my task, tasklist and parser files helped the 
generated code be very close to what I am looking to create and it saved a lot of time too. I think my prompts were too 
specific in some cases so the AI started hard coding values in, which I corrected myself.

### Estimated Time saved: 20 minutes
